                  in the Early Years Classroom</p>
                  <p>Having 25 small people entrusted to me for a year of  their lives is a both a responsibility and a privilege. I know how important the  elementary years are in the development of caring, knowledgeable and responsible  adults. I believe that my relationship with them is instrumental in modeling  the learner profiles and an optimistic belief in each child now and for their  future. I like to encourage independence skills in my students and a sense of  ownership and pride in their own and other&rsquo;s work. </p>
                  <p>My personal philosophy is &ldquo;to make everyday in the  classroom matter&rdquo; and putting lots of effort into planning, collaboration and  reflection makes this a reality. To this end, I also use the standards and  expectations of the school curriculum and give the children deliberate,  meaningful learning opportunities to enable them to incrementally meet these  standards and regularly monitor their progress. Routines are also important for  class life and &lsquo;little bits of rich learning&rsquo; can be included in the daily  rituals and transitions.</p>
                  <p>I have a developmental approach to assessing each  child&rsquo;s skills and learning needs. I also know that students have different  thinking styles, interests and backgrounds. Taking regular observations, photos  and anecdotal records provides valuable evidence for the above and enables me  to differentiate my teaching. They are also valuable for keeping parents regularly  in touch with their child&rsquo;s life in the classroom. </p>
                  <p>We all enjoy communicating and being seen and heard  for the interesting people we all are. I encourage opportunities for every  child to communicate who they are, as well as what they think, wonder, see and  feel. People are also naturally interested in each other and the classroom is a  fertile place for learning from peers and developing valuable friendships and  social skills. In the early years this is of particular importance as children  broaden their social circle from family to include&nbsp; classmates and teachers. </p>
                  <p>I love stories, poems, songs, visuals, puppets and  books and I use these daily to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>frontload information, ideas,  perspectives for units.</li>
                    <li>model reading strategies and a  love of reading and books</li>
                    <li>show &lsquo;mentor texts&rsquo; (work from  a single author/illustrator/genre) to model and analyze motivations,  conventions and characteristics of writing and writers. </li>
                    <li>raise specific issues (e.g.  changes in family life or class life issues)</li>
                    <li>broaden my students  perspective and understanding of the world through story telling</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In the early years, I teach mathematics in how it is  meaningful and authentic to the child. I use number &lsquo;stories&rsquo; and real examples  every day, e.g. people in your family; how many teeth have you lost; birthdays;  classroom times; patterns in the calendar and in all ways that numbers can  relate to the inquiry units. I also use manipulatives in playful and structured  ways to bridge the important step from concrete to  abstract mathematical thinking. Playing math&nbsp;  games are an excellent way for practicing number skills and knowledge  and learning from one another. I enjoy the challenge of teaching mathematics in  all sorts of fun ways.</p>
<p>My personal interpretation of how the PYP works in my  classroom is that there are six inquiry themes throughout the year on which all  learning is based. They provide the background landscape on which experiences  are had; questions are asked, stories are told and information shared. There is  also an overarching generic &lsquo;process&rsquo; that stipulates what happens at the  beginning, middle and end of each Unit. It is also expected that as this  &lsquo;process of inquiry&rsquo; unfolds in the classroom it  will also &lsquo;inform&rsquo; itself. Earlier decisions may be renegotiated or un-made  decisions are left open, until closer to the time that they are needed to be  made. I found that this sense &lsquo;not knowing in advance&rsquo; (although vaguely  uncomfortable) always kept me listening out for clues and sign posts in the  class discussions as to &lsquo;what, or where to go next? In this way, the choices  the children make are able to be included and the dynamic and responsive nature  of inquiry learning is supported. </p>
                  <p>Here are some &lsquo;notes to self&rsquo; I made on  how to support the &lsquo;nature of inquiry&rsquo;:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>model curiosity: if I  do &lsquo;wonder&rsquo;, say so</li>
                    <li>give open-ended  experiences (where choices and outcomes are broad) </li>
                    <li>give challenges (where  the choices are deliberately limited); </li>
                    <li>a little bit of fun  goes a long-learning-way </li>
                    <li>encourage, no, <em>expect</em> reflection and thinking time  regularly </li>
                    <li>keep everything simple  (some of the most treasured learning experiences have simple beginnings)</li>
                    <li>listen for any  connections being made, and voice them</li>
                    <li>don&rsquo;t lose faith if  they &lsquo;don&rsquo;t seem to get it yet&rsquo; - every bit does count, we only see the tip of  the &lsquo;what am I learning?&rsquo; iceberg</li>
                    <li>these early years are  a lot about developing the &lsquo;learning self&rsquo; rather than finding or knowing the  right answers </li>
                    <li>admire: constantly be  amazed at what they can do already and they&rsquo;ve only been on this planet for a  few short years!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>My experience is that a school is an  intense environment with multiple types of professional relationships, roles  and demands. As a teacher, I am careful to be respectful and professional to  all I meet, and to stay aware of when I need to invest more time and energy into  my work and colleagues. I also know when it is appropriate to pace myself and  pull back and prioritize my time and energies so that I can make every day  matter for my students in the classroom.</p></td>
