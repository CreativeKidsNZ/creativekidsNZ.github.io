      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>– Hobbit House and Garden – </strong><br />
        This is a good introduction to working with clay and excites the  imagination around model making, mythical creatures and natural materials. We  will make a clay house and garden and decorate with a wide selection of natural  materials such as shells and moss. The hobbit house and garden is on a  cardboard tray and ready for each participant to take home.</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>– Gone Fishing –</strong><br />
        A printing, drawing and  construction activity in which each participant makes a fishing game (with 2  rods, a 'water' mat, fish and box) and takes it home to play with others during  the holidays.</p>
